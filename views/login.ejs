                        <p class="card-text">Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard has been momentous news today, as much for the scale of the deal as its shock value. But we shouldn’t be too surprised. 
                            This was inevitable. A handful of companies have always wanted to own everything, and nothing is going to stop them. 
                            The proposed sale—technicalities dictate I need to remind you that it still needs to be approved—involves some earth-shattering numbers. 
                            $70 billion is fake money, a make-believe sum normally reserved for national budgets and defence deals.</p><br>

                            it appears that water in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has been improved. This could be a good sign for future emulation quality on Nintendo Switch Online.

                            Now, after all that, Ubisoft’s newest and weirdest entry in the Rainbow Six franchise is finally out and I’m not sure what shocked me more: is it how much I’m enjoying killing aliens or that Extraction manages to be fun in an already crowded genre?</p><br>
