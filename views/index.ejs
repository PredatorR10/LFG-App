    <h3>This was Inevitable</h3>

    <h4>Microsoft's proposed $70 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard is just the beginning </br> by: Luke Plunkett</h4>

    <p>
        Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard has been momentous news today, as much for the scale of the deal as its shock value. But we shouldn’t be too surprised. 
        This was inevitable. A handful of companies have always wanted to own everything, and nothing is going to stop them. 
        The proposed sale—technicalities dictate I need to remind you that it still needs to be approved—involves some earth-shattering numbers. 
        $70 billion is fake money, a make-believe sum normally reserved for national budgets and defence deals. Uniting these two companies, 
        with all those properties and all those games, alongside a home console and a massively-popular subscription service, has instantly changed the entire shape of the video 
        game industry.
